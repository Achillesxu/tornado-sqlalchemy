`tornado-sqlalchemy` is a Python library aimed at integrating the tornado_ web
framework and the SQLAlchemy_ database toolkit (with a later version looking
into possibly integrating alembic_ as well to provide an all-in-one solution for
someone looking into adding database capabilities to their web application).

This project is heavily under development, and makes no promises about the
stability until the API stabilizes. You have been warned!
